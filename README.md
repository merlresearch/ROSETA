# Robust Online Subspace Estimation and Tracking Algorithm (ROSETA)

This script implements a revised version of the robust online subspace estimation and tracking algorithm (ROSETA) that is capable of identifying and tracking a time-varying low dimensional subspace from incomplete measurements and in the presence of sparse outliers. The algorithm minimizes a robust l1 norm cost function between the observed measurements and their projection onto the estimated subspace. The projection coefficients and sparse outliers are computed using a LASSO solver and the subspace estimate is updated using a proximal point iteration with adaptive parameter selection.

## Usage

To run the script with the example data set, simply run the file `motion_separation.m` in MATLAB.
